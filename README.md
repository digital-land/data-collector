# Data Collector
A simple set of Lambda functions to collect and store data from remote sources. This data collector runs on AWS and uses [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/),  [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can see the [output](http://digital-land-data-collector-test.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com) in the development environment.
